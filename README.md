Swagger Documentation
Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html. You can use this interface to explore the API endpoints, view request and response structures, and test the endpoints.

Docker Configuration
The application can also be run as a Docker container. The Dockerfile is configured to use the official OpenJDK 11 runtime as the parent image. It exposes port 8082 and runs the application using the JAR file.

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY target/AccountApi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app

# Make port 8082 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8082

# Run the application when the container launches
CMD ["java", "-jar", "AccountApi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
Build the Docker image and run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t account-api .
docker run -p 8082:8082 account-api
The API, along with Swagger documentation, will be accessible at http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html.
